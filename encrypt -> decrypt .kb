#1 Example: you → encrypt, he → decrypt :
and im encrypt the you friand decrypt , encrypted : 
echo "you text" > message.txt and secret.txt (file decrypt the encrypt) 
openssl pkeyutl -encrypt -pubin -inkey friand_public.pem -in message.txt -out encrypted.bin
explanation :
{
friend_public.pem — friend's public key

message.txt — your message

encrypted.bin — encrypted binary file you send
}
He decrypts with his private key: 
openssl pkeyutl -decrypt -inkey private.pem -in encrypted.bin -out decrypted.txt 
explanation :
{
private.pem — his private key

encrypted.bin — the file you sent

decrypted.txt — the decrypted result (will contain your original message)
}

Why does this work?
Because in asymmetric encryption:

The public key encrypts

Only the corresponding private key can decrypt

No one else - not even you - can read what's encrypted unless you have their private key.
