#1 create work environment
create and notepad  new faile : decrypted the encrypted --- itself encrypting 
open PowerShell then end check openssl --- openssl version 
then open version OpenSSL 3.5.0 8 Apr 2025 (Library: OpenSSL 3.5.0 8 Apr 2025) maybe differently 
№2 explanation of why encryption is needed
encryption is needed to protect your information from intruders and for confidentiality.
it is also an unsecured part of cybersecurity, helping to send your or another person s information in a more anonymous form and there is a key without which it will not be possible to decrypt.
also for various very large certificates it is useful to encrypt yourself and store the key in a good place.
    and encryption is also used to encrypt websites, there is also important information there
also in social networks such as telegram, github, instagram, etc.
finances for different banks simply need to be encrypted, for example, the transfer system and to whom, or payment for something through a bank, encryption is also used there
this end explanation
#3 and code encrypting aes -- 256
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -salt -in message.txt -out encrypted.bin -pass pass:her text --- not space
encrypting: 
  openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -salt -in message.txt -out encrypted.bin -pass pass:hertext
decrypting :
  openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -in encrypted.bin -out decrypted.txt -pass pass:hertext
open notepad
notepad decrypted.txt
